This folder are made to have winning icons and seperate
just so it works in both here and Psych Engine.

Icons can work with 300x150 but if you are not planning on
adding a winning icon, put them in the normal icons folder.
Otherwise the image must be a minimal of 450x150, icons also must have
a 'icon-' or else it won't be read, and I reccomend also putting those icons
in the icons folder but remove the winning icon since Psych Engine can't run
this folder.
